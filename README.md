# Monty Programming Language Compiler

## Overview

This project is a mini compiler for the Monty programming language. Monty is a simple stack-based programming language designed for educational purposes. The compiler takes Monty source code as input and produces executable machine code or intermediate code.

## Features

- **Stack-based Language**: Monty follows a stack-based paradigm, where operations are performed on a stack of values.
  
- **Compilation**: Converts Monty source code into executable machine code or intermediate code.

- **Error Handling**: Provides detailed error messages and diagnostics for easier debugging.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., GCC).

### Building

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/OnGod123/monty-compiler.git
    cd monty-compiler
    ```

2. Build the compiler:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

3. Run the compiler:

    ```bash
    ./monty-compiler input.m
    ```

## Usage

```bash
./monty-compiler <input_file>
